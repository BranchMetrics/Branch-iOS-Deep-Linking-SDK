/**
The `BranchShareActivitySheet` class facilitates sharing Branch links using a `UIActivityViewController` user experience.

The `BranchShareActivitySheet` is a new class that is similiar to but has more functionality than the old `[BranchUniversalObject showShareSheetWithLinkProperties:...]` methods.

The `BranchShareActivitySheet` is initialized with the `BranchUniversalObject` and `BranchLinkProperties` objects that will be used to generate the Branch link.

After the `BranchShareActivitySheet` object is created, set any configuration properties on the activity sheet object, and then call `showFromViewController:anchor:` to show the activity sheet.

A delegate on the BranchShareActivitySheet can further configure the share experience. For instance the link parameters can be changed depending on the activity that the user selects.
